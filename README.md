# Complete Guide to Control Systems in Python

Created by Engineer Lautaro Kamimura Varela for the Control Systems course of the Aerospace Engineering program at the National Technological University, Haedo Regional Faculty, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

This repository contains a complete interactive guide on control systems, implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The guide covers from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques in control systems analysis and design.

   - Second-order systems analysis
   - Damping factor
   - Natural undamped frequency

3. **Root Locus**
   - Stability analysis
   - Gain selection
   - Compensator design
   - Root locus rules
   - Dominant poles visualization

4. **Compensators**
